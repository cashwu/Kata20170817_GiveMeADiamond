# [Give me a Diamond](https://www.codewars.com/kata/give-me-a-diamond/csharp)

This kata is to practice simple string output. Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.

###Task:

You need to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk ("`*`") characters. Please see provided test cases for exact output format.

The shape that will be returned from `print` method resembles a diamond, where the number provided as input represents the number of `*`’s printed on the middle line. The line above and below will be centered and will have 2 less `*`’s than the middle line. This reduction by 2 `*`’s for each line continues until a line with a single `*` is printed at the top and bottom of the figure.

Return `null` if input is even number or negative (as it is not possible to print diamond with even number or negative number).

Please see provided test case(s) for examples.
